>Software is eating the world. 
    - Marc Andreessen (Co-founder of Netscape)

Books, Videos, Music, Communications, Advertising. All these areas have seen some tremendous success for various disruptive companies. You know the ones. Notice that that they are essentially **all** software companies. The products themselves are incidental. The traditional product branded companies have been and are being disrupted by technology driven software companies.

## The Software Company

A software company is one that recognises that, at it's core, it is software that runs everthing. Software is key and the key.

Not matter what or where we build software, ultimately, what we have is **binary code** represented in silicon, doing our bidding.

## The Code
Where does the binary code come from except from coders, developers, engineers. Call them what you will, but someone who uses a language abstraction to create the instructions for the machines to follow.

The business value stream needs many actors, each doing their valuable part in producing needed outcomes and hopefully improved customer benefits. Although there is no doubt all these players are vitally important, in the end without code there is nothing, zero. This is our real first cause. 

Those companies that release this have already raised the profile of those persons, traditionally the developers, and their importance in  overall software delivery. So much so that they are now an important part of key business decisions. This has been highlighted in part by the DevOps movement, in that Developers (read coders) are now part and parcel of the whole delivery. All the way to production, the adage being **we build, we run**. The CIO is now in the board room, with a realisation that the critical need is for talented and empowered **coders**.

## The coder
For a true coder, an in-depth knowledge of the vagaries of a coding language or languagues is not sufficient. Also needed is having vision, imagination and creativity to craft one's code with a certain beauty. With this comes a desire to keep learning.

The idea of a code monkey blindly writing code to some handed down specification is a falacity. No true coder can just follow a process, they will instead have a knack of seeing what is really necessary in a process or system. They will want to help deliver the best while being aware of the many related areas. Perhaps this why we are starting to see the term **software engineers**. We now look for those cognisant of various aspects of software coding, built in testing, performance, monitoring, deployment, continous integration and automation for example.

A good coder does not have to know every single detail to the Nth degree to get the job done and reach the goal. Time spent learning every last detail of a technology may make you an expert but only for the moment when the technology is in vogue. Especially in the fast pace of change that software development experiences. Knowing how **much** you need to know before you can achieve a task is a good skill.

A rock star coder is great to have perhaps, but a group of rock stars perform less well than a group of average coders who collaborate and work as a team. Rock stars are harder to find and retain. See the [myth of a rockstar developer](https://hackernoon.com/the-myth-of-a-rockstar-developer-e6564bd51b5c?gi=4e89fafecdbd).

They also come with their own problems, hence [why we fired our top talent].(https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde)

The one thing that really motivates a coder is to see that their code is working in production. The satisfaction of having created something that is serving a purpose. Even better when that has been achieved as a team, the reason for being a company.

Talent needs to be balanced with character...

## Culture

Interestingly, Lean, Agile, DevOps all have culture and empowerment in common.

> Integrated development and continuous delivery can only happen within a corporate culture that empowers its software developers and refines its IT and R&D reporting structures. From:  https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/beyond-agile-reorganizing-it-for-faster-software-delivery

A culture suitable for a modern software company needs to adopt true agile, lean and devops practices. Centre to this is the empowerment of the people on the shop floor. 

### Empowerment

There are many reasons to enable empowerment. In agile delivery, the ability to control the whole delivery process to production, as a self governing team, provides great benefits with faster speed to market. This also helps in forecasting so that the team can now provide an estimate that reflects true business value. Hand-offs to other teams, usually with undefined SLA's, make it impossible to guage true team velocity. Forecasting the delivery of product increments or the overall roadmap is only possible when teams are empowered to own the whole.

The ability to deploy to production is also a great motivator for coders as mentioned. A coder then doesn't just write code but forms a vital part of overall delivery. 

Everything now needs to be considered as code. Configuration, environments, data, applications, testing, operations, business processes, governance, security. Everything in the delivery process could be version controlled and be auditable. In this regard we see that almost all things are defined and driven by code even within the software delivery process. So in all aspects a coder is now key, expect that now its not just the application.

### Colloboration

A cross functional team with all the skills needed in the team, empowered to deploy software on demand is a vital cultural change. With this the team then has the ability to bring value to business rapidly, to adapt quickly to changes in the business environment and be able disrupt the market for the business. This requires de-centralization of traditional responsibilities and putting the keys in the hands of the development team. Another useful change is that of business and engineering teams working closely together using the concept of ideas and validated learnings rather than handed down requirements. A third change is that of moving from project focus to product focus and funding based on limited time or scope (but not both) rather than a fixed project lifetime. 

### Walking the Gemba
  
>Genba (現場, also romanized as gemba) is a Japanese term meaning "the actual place". Japanese detectives call the crime scene genba, and Japanese TV reporters may refer to themselves as reporting from genba. In business, genba refers to the place where value is created...
    - Wikipedia
 
For any software based organisation, the actualisation of value is really created with writing the code. The idea may come at the concept creation stage, but to materialise this, you need to have code. With colloborative working, functioning software can rightly and accurately shape and help deliver business ideas. 

Walking the gemba, listening to those at the coal face, those writing the code brings huge benefits. This allows ideas that improve delivery and outcomes to come from those critical to the delivery. 


## Governance, Risk and Compliance

## The Power of Code
  
Anyone heard of DotCloud? But you've heard of docker right? Written by Solomon Hykes of DotCloud, docker is a piece of sofware. Docker has now become ubiquitous and has superceded the original company's focus so much so that the company adopted it as a brand. That is some coding.

Much code is now open source and helps drive innovation in many software companies that in the past would have relied on proprietary software. 

A few open source projects to warm your heart:

Linux, MySQL, Eclipse, Kubernetes, Tensorflow, the HashiCorp set (Vagrant, Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault).
